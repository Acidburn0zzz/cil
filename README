SELinux Common Intermediate Language (CIL) Compiler

INTRODUCTION

	The SELinux CIL Compiler is a compiler that converts the CIL language as
	described on the CIL design wiki into a policy.conf file. Please see the
	CIL Design Wiki at http://userspace.selinuxproject.org/trac/wiki/CilDesign
	for more information about the goals and features on the CIL language.

	Run "make" with one of the following targets:

	make
		Build the CIL compiler (cilc)

	make unit
		Build the unit_test application to run unit tests

	make coverage
		Build the unit test binary and create coverage reports

	make clean
		Remove temporary build files
	
	make bare
