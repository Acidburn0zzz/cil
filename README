SELinux Common Intermediate Language (CIL) Compiler

INTRODUCTION

	The SELinux CIL Compiler is a compiler that converts the CIL language as
	described on the CIL design wiki into a policy.conf file. Please see the
	CIL Design Wiki at http://userspace.selinuxproject.org/trac/wiki/CilDesign
	for more information about the goals and features on the CIL language.

DEPENDENCIES

	gcc >= 4.5.1
	libsepol-static >= 2.1.0
	lcov >= 1.9
	flex-static >= 2.5.35


BUILD STEPS

	Open a terminal client and execute the following command to download the source code:

			git clone http://oss.tresys.com/git/cil.git

	Change directory into the "cil" directory.
	Run "make" with one of the following targets:

	make
		Build the CIL compiler (secilc)

	make unit
		Build the unit_test application to run unit tests

	make coverage
		Build the unit test binary and create coverage reports

	make clean
		Remove temporary build files

	make bare
		Remove temporary build files and compile binaries


USAGE

	Execute 'secilc' with any number of CIL files as arguments. A binary policy and
	file_contexts file will be created.

	Use the '--help' option for more details.


KNOWN ISSUES

	- Blocks inside of macros causes undefined behavior

	- Policy must be well formed. For example, invalid usage of
	  sensitivities/categories/levels may create an unloaded binary

	- Recursive limits are not handled
